My research focuses on understanding the interplay between landscapes and people through the use of digital data and GIS mapping (Geographic Information Science). My objective is to take a critical perspective in order to understand different interpretations of any set of spatial data. This involves developing innovative methodologies from data science (combining statistics and computer programming) and applying them within a landscape context.

As such I am interested in how landscapes are both presented and interpreted from digital representations. However, a critical perspective is required because we should always remember that models are merely simplifications of reality. In the words of statistician George Box, “All models are wrong but some are useful.”
