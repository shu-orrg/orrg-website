I have been interested in the psychology and mental health for a long time. I completed my BSc (Hons) at the University of Stirling in 2008 and my desire to find effective ways of working with people with mental health issues led me to do a PhD in 2009. Employing a qualitative methodology, the thesis investigated human-environment interaction and people's meaning-making and experience of a Walking and Solo Experience (WSE). The WSE was designed for the UK context and, with a summer mountain leader award (MLA), I guided the WSE.
