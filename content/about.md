## What is the Outdoor Recreation Research Group?
We are the first cross-disciplinary research group in the UK looking at the
growing sector of outdoor recreation from all perspectives. Bringing together
economists, social scientists, ecologists, engineers and behavioural change
and tourism experts, we are the home of expertise in the way we play outdoors
– and the important economy behind it.

## What do we do?
We work with local authorities, national bodies, recreation providers, sport
companies and anybody else with an interest in outdoor recreation to provide
evidence, expertise and consultancy.

## Work we have undertaken
Sheffield’s Outdoor Economy and The Outdoor City
In 2014/15, ORRG were commissioned by Sheffield City Council to report on the
size, scale, and scope of Sheffield's 'Outdoor Economy'. The strength of the
data that we provided led to Sheffield declaring itself 'The Outdoor City' and
launching an outdoor strategy and accompanying marketing campaign.  Read the
report here: Everything grows outside - including jobs and the economy (PDF,
780 KB). The Outdoor City brand continues to grow and Maxine Gregory and Prof
Rob Copeland from ORRG have supported this development since 2015 through
their roles on the project steering group.

### Developing Active Environments
Since 2016, ORRG has been working with and supporting Harworth Estates to
develop their flagship Waverley site using an 'Active Environment' concept.
The innovative ORRG project has brought together specialists in community
consultation and engagement, along with design and technology experts to
develop and test concepts.  Reporting on the project is due soon, but you can

### Sheffield Lakeland Landscape Partnership (SLLP)

In 2017 ORRG was commissioned to provide an 'Access and Gateways Appraisal' to
inform the development of the Landscape Conservation Action Plan for a £2.8
million Heritage Lottery Funded project. ORRG’s most interdisciplinary project
to date, combined consultation and engagement work with expertise focused on
environmental and ecosystem protection, local history and heritage, access,
mapping and surveying. The end product was highly commended and supported the
development and implementation of the project going forwards. The feedback
received from the client included the following comments:

“You took considerable care to understand what it was we were trying to
achieve and to explore priorities.  The volume and quality of data collected
considerably exceeded expectations and gave a real robustness underpinning the
access projects in the programme.  I have attached the projects that we
developed as a result of your report - which hopefully is a good way of
demonstrating how useful it was.  The fact that this was achieved at a
difficult time of year weather-wise and in a compressed time-frame was also
impressive. The contribution to the statement of significance was excellent
and broader than just access / accessibility issues. Thank you for an
excellent piece of work - you were a pleasure to work with and hope we can
work with you again in the future”.
